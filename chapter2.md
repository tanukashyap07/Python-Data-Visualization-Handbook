# 🤔 Why Do We Need Different Types of Charts?

Imagine you have the following data.

| Month | Sales |
|--------|-------|
| Jan | 120 |
| Feb | 150 |
| Mar | 190 |
| Apr | 230 |

Can we use a Pie Chart?

❌ No.

Because this data represents **change over time**.

A **Line Chart** is the correct choice.

Now consider this data.

| Product | Sales |
|----------|-------|
| Laptop | 200 |
| Mobile | 350 |
| Tablet | 120 |

Here we compare different categories.

The correct choice is

📊 **Bar Chart**

This shows that **every chart has a specific purpose.**
